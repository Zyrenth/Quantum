## Notice

Currently the CLI can rapidly change as we are still in the early stages of development. For this reason, this guide is not yet available. We will update this guide as soon as the CLI gets into a more consistent state. Please refer to the source code and command help for a little amount of documentation. If you want to contribute to the CLI, just follow the code style and structure of the existing code and if there are issues it will be addressed in the PR.

## Tests

The same applies to the tests. Since the CLI can change rapidly, writing tests for it is not yet feasible.
